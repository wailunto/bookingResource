A library booking system database design should include tables for books, 
authors, publishers, members, and reservations. 
The books table should have columns for book ID, 
title, author ID, publisher ID, and ISBN. 

The authors table should have columns for author ID and name.
 The publishers table should have columns for publisher ID and name. 
 The members table should have columns for member ID, name, address, phone number, 
 and email address. 
 
The reservations table should have columns for reservation ID, member ID,
 book ID, reservation date, 
 and return date1.
